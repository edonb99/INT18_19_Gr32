    <h2>Giving children & teenagers an environmental voiceâ€¦</h2>
    <p>The Eco-Schools programme is an ideal way for schools to embark on a meaningful path towards improving the environment in both the school and the local community while at the same time having a life-long positive impact on the lives of young people and their families.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Eco-Schools programme provides a unique opportunity that empowers pupils to lead change within their school and have a positive impact in their wider community. The programme encourages pupils of all ages and abilities to work together to develop their knowledge and environmental awareness. Independent research into the Eco-Schools programme in England found evidence of the positive impacts on pupils, including increased confidence, development of leaderships skills, improved pupil well-being and behaviour and greater motivation at school.</p>
    <br>
    <p>While the Seven Steps are the most important aspect of the Eco-Schools programme, schools also work on topics to help give the programme even more structure;<b> marine, biodiversity, energy, litter, global citizenship, healthy living, school grounds, transport, waste and water</b>.</p>
